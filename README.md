# SimianArmy Docker image

A docker image to run Netflix's [SimianArmy](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy) monkeys.

WARNING! This uses the current CI snapshot at time of build rather
than a release build (is there such a thing?).

See the Dockerfile for environment variables that can be set to
override the configuration.
